// 1. Thank you for volunteering to document our pumpkin library! Let's start by grabbing the first
// paragraph from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin and pasting it as our module-level
// documentation. Hint: Use inner-documentation comments.
//
// Once you've got the documentation here, run `cargo doc --no-deps --open` and take a look!

// 2. What about an image!? Add an image of a pumpkin to the end of the module-level documentation.
// The markdown format is ![some alt text](https://url-to-the-image.png)
// Here's the image to link to: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/FrenchMarketPumpkinsB.jpg/700px-FrenchMarketPumpkinsB.jpg

// 3. Document the Pumpkin struct.
// - The description on the index page should be "Big orange thing"
// - Make a section header called "Recipes"
// - Explain that recipes will be coming soon.
// - Explain that "roundness" is a percentage
// - Explain that "orangeness" is a number from 8 to 27

//! A pumpkin is a cultivar of winter squash that is round with smooth, slightly ribbed skin, and 
//! is most often deep yellow to orange in coloration. The thick shell contains the seeds and pulp. 
//! The name is most commonly used for cultivars of Cucurbita pepo, but some cultivars of Cucurbita maxima,
//!  C. argyrosperma, and C. moschata with similar appearance are also sometimes called "pumpkin".

// 4. Explain that if you smash the pumpkin, it will be gone. Then it can't be used for pie. :'-(

// 5. Document that BURNT_ORANGE is for the "orangeness" field in the Pumpkin struct.
// - Link to the Pumpkin struct in your description

/// BURNT_ORANGE is for the "orangeness" field in the [`Pumpkin`] struct.
pub const BURNT_ORANGE: i32 = 13;

// Challenge: Find the option to pass to `cargo doc` so that documentation for this private item
// gets generated as well.  Hint: `cargo doc -h`

/// For internal use only. In fact, this documentation is so private that it won't be generated.
/// At least not by default.
enum PrivateEnum {
    /// For Halloween. To be lit by candlelight.
    JackOLantern,
    /// For dessert during North American winter holidays.
