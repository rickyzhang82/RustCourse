    //   should return from your trait implementation should be:
    //

    // 4. You prefer Maple Bacon cake. Use "struct update syntax" to create a Dessert with `cake`
    // set to `Cake::MapleBacon`, but the rest of the values are default.
    //
    // Hint: The trick to struct update syntax is specifying the value(s) you want to customize and
    // then ending the struct with `..Default::default()` -- but no comma after that!

    // let party = Party {
    //     ...
    // };
    // println!("Yes! My party has my favorite {:?} cake!", party.cake);

    // 5. Parties are "equal" if they have the same cake.
    // - Derive the PartialEq trait for the Cake enum so Cakes can be compared.
    // - Manually implement the PartialEq trait for Party. If different parties have the same cake,
    // then they are equal.
    // - Uncomment and run the code below.

    // let other_party = Party {
    //     at_restaurant: false,
    //     num_people: 235,
    //     cake: Cake::MapleBacon,
    // };
    // if party == other_party {
    //     println!("Your party is just like mine!");
    // }

    // Challenge: You would like to be able to pass a Party struct into the smell_cake() function
    // which takes a type T which implements the Into<Cake> trait.
    // - Uncomment the code below AND the smell_cake() function at the bottom of this file
    // - Implement From<Party> for Cake so that the code below will work.

    // smell_cake(party);
